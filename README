Implementation of a subset of fnmatch on llvm. 
This is just an exercise in implementing a pattern matching language JIT
on LLVM, perhaps a stepping stone towards implementing a full regular
expression engine.

This code operates on 8-bit octets rather than unicode characters. It only
understands the following expressions:
 - '?' matches any single character
 - '*' matches any zero or more characters
 - '[xyz]' matches any of 'x', 'y', or 'z' (ranges are not supported)
 - '\x' matches the character 'x' literally (ie: escaping)
 - any other character matches literally
